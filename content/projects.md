The Micklem group works in the field of integrative genomics â€“ applying high throughput experimental methods and using bioinformatics to solve real world problems. Some of our work focuses on the challenge of effective data integration, developing new tools and providing community resources using our data warehouse system [InterMine](http://www.intermine.org). As these approaches can be applied to many areas, our research ranges across a number of fields, and includes de novo genome sequencing and annotation to obtain insights into gene function and evolution, genomic studies of parasite action, cancer biology, as well as exploratory work in the emerging field of synthetic biology.

Current projects include:
