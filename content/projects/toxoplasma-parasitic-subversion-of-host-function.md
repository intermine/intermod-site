summary: <p>Infection by <i>Toxoplasma</i> are a cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. This project, in collaboration with <a href="http://www.path.cam.ac.uk/~toxo/">Jim Ajioka</a> in Pathology and Arnab Pain at <a href="http://www.kaust.edu.sa/">KAUST</a>, focuses on the genomics and proteomics of <i>Toxoplasma</i> infection, and the changes it brings about in the host, with a focus on potential therapy targets.</p>

"body": "Infection by members of the parasitic protozoan phylum Apicomplexa, such as *Plasmodium* (malaria) and *Toxoplasma* are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The problem is further compounded by the efficacy of drug treatment waning due to the emergence of drug resistance in the parasites in questions.

This project uses genomic and proteomic methods to further our understanding of host-parasite interactions during *Toxoplasma* infection. Specifically, we aim to study the manner in which the parasite controls gene expression for growth and development, and how the parasite disrupts host function through protein secretion. Insights into these mechanisms have the potential to be used for therapy development.

A project in collaboration with [Jim Ajioka](http://www.path.cam.ac.uk/~toxo/) in Pathology and Arnab Pain at [KAUST](http://www.kaust.edu.sa/).
