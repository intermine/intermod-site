We have created and continue to develop the data warehouse system [InterMine](http://www.intermine.org), as well as a number of databases that use the system, including [FlyMine](http://www.flymine.org) for the Drosophila community, [modMine](http://intermine.modencode.org/) for modENCODE project data, and [metabolicMine](http://www.metabolicmine.org/) for human, rat and mouse metabolic disease data. We are currently in the process of developing HumanMine for a wide range of human genetic data.

In collaboration with a number of major model organism databases, we lead the [InterMOD consortium](/funding/intermod) â€“ an initiative to implement InterMine databases for budding yeast, nematode worm, rat, mouse, zebrafish and fruit fly, as well as creating cross-organism analysis tools to enable users to benefit from their diverse datasets.

More information on the InterMine system is available at [http://www.intermine.org](http://www.intermine.org). For links to the known public InterMine databases, see our [Resources](/resources) page.
