A project in collaboration with [Alan Tunnacliffe](http://www.ceb.cam.ac.uk/groups.php?id=16&name=cell-and-organism-engineering).

Bdelloid rotifers are microscopic animals that have survived without sex for millions of years and are able to survive desiccation at all life stages through a process called anhydrobiosis. As such, their genomes contain unique adaptations, some of which are the focus of this project.

A large scale transcriptome analysis indicates an extremely high rate of horizontal gene transfer. Bdelloid rotifers express horizontally acquired genes on a scale unprecedented in animals, and foreign genes make a profound contribution to their metabolism. This represents a potential mechanism for ancient asexuals to adapt rapidly to changing environments and thereby persist over long evolutionary time periods in the absence of sex.
