The Micklem Lab develops data integration tools and takes part in functional genomics projects. We develop and maintain the open-source data warehouse system [InterMine](http://www.intermine.org/), as well as running a number of data warehouses based on the system, including [FlyMine](http://www.flymine.org/), [modMine](http://intermine.modencode.org/) and [metabolicMine](http://www.metabolicmine.org/) (for a full list of data warehouses based on the InterMine system, see our [Resources](/resources) page). We are also in the process of developing HumanMine - a comprehensive database of human genetic, genomic and proteomic data.
