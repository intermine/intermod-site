We are an interdisciplinary research group, using computational and laboratory techniques to carry out basic and applied research in biology. A special focus is on the development and application of integrative genomics methods.

Our work ranges from developing open source community [resources](/resources) such as the data warehouse system [InterMine](http://www.intermine.org), to collaborative [research projects](/projects) in a range of areas including genome sequencing and annotation, functional genomics, synthetic biology and cancer research.

To find out more, see our [projects](/projects) and [publications](/publications) pages, or [get in touch](/contact)!
