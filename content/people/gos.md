Gos Micklem carried out his PhD and postdoctoral research in budding yeast and *Drosophila* molecular genetics. He later switched to computational research at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, where his work on human genomic sequence annotation formed the basis of the ENSEMBL annotation pipeline.  After three years he joined a biotech start-up company to head bioinformatics, and four years later joined the University of Cambridge [Department of Genetics](http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk).  In 2004 he was made Director of the Cambridge Computational Biology Institute ([CCBI](http://www.ccbi.cam.ac.uk)), based in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics ([DAMTP](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk)).  He remains a member of the Department of Genetics and his group is based in the Cambridge Systems Biology Centre ([CSBC](http://www.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/)).
