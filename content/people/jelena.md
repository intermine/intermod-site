Gos Micklem carried out his PhD and postdoctoral research in budding yeast and *Drosophila* molecular genetics. He later switched to computational research at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, where his work on human genomic sequence annotation formed the basis of the ENSEMBL annotation pipeline.  After three years he joined a biotech start-up company to head bioinformatics, and four years later joined the University of Cambridge [Department of Genetics](http://www.gen.cam.ac.uk).  In 2004 he was made Director of the Cambridge Computational Biology Institute ([CCBI](http://www.ccbi.cam.ac.uk)), based in the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics ([DAMTP](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk)).  He remains a member of the Department of Genetics and his group is based in the Cambridge Systems Biology Centre ([CSBC](http://www.sysbiol.cam.ac.uk/)).

The Micklem group develops the data integration platform InterMine, and maintains a number of databases which use the InterMine framework, including FlyMine, modMine (as part of the modENCODE project) and metabolicMine. Within the modENCODE project he is co-PI of the Data Coordinating Center. Development is beginning soon on HumanMine, a data warehouse of human genetic, genomic and proteomic data.  His other research interests include genome sequencing and analysis (Bdelloid rotifer, *Stylophora*, *Symbiodinium*), *Toxoplasma* genomics, and synthetic biology.
