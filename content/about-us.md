InterMOD is an international consortium currently composed of these five major model organism databases working with the InterMine group whose goals include implementing standardised links among the different organism datasets to enable faster comparative studies and developing tools that make this type of analysis accessible to the wider scientific community.

The InterMOD project started in 2009 with RGD, SGD and ZFIN all creating their own mines. They were joined in 2011 by MGI and WormBase.
