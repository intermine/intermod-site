An integrated data warehouse of rat genomic data. This data warehouse has been developed first by Simon Twigger's group, and now by [Liz Worthey's group](http://www.mcw.edu/HMGC/Laboratories/Worthey.htm) at the model organism database RGD. It is part of the [InterMOD project](/funding/intermod) â€“ an initiative to set up interoperability links between datasets from a number of major model organisms, including nematode worm, budding yeast, fruit fly, rat, mouse, zebrafish and human.
