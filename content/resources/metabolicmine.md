A data warehouse targeted at the metabolic disease community. Developed by the Micklem Lab in collaboration with leading UK metabolic disease groups, metabolicMine integrates disease datasets from a range of experiments and model organisms alongside tools for exploring them, enabling the metabolic research community to search across domains of biological knowledge. The current version brings together information covering genes, proteins, orthologues, interactions, expression, pathways, ontologies, diseases, GWAS and SNPs. While the emphasis is on human data, key datasets from mouse and rat are included.
