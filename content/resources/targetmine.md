A data warehouse for candidate gene prioritisation and drug target discovery. This data warehouse has been developed by [Kenji Mizuguchi's lab](http://mizuguchilab.org/) at NIBIO, Japan, in order to facilitate a more efficient prioritisation of candidate genes for further exploration in biomedical studies, based on an integrated data approach. TargetMine utilises the InterMine framework, with new data models such as protein-DNA interactions integrated in a novel way. It enables complicated searches that are difficult to perform with existing tools and it also offers integration of custom annotations and in-house experimental data.
