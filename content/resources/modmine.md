The modENCODE project data warehouse, developed by the Micklem Lab as part of the [modENCODE Data Coordination Centre](/funding/modencode). The aim of the modENCODE project was to characterise functional elements in the genomes of the model organisms *Drosophila* and *C. elegans*. modMine provides users with access to tools for data browsing and basic analysis, and a range of datasets generated by modENCODE can be downloaded from there. These include a wide range of genomics experiments such as ChIP-seq and gene expression profiling, as well as studies focusing on gene and chromatin structure, replication and copy number variation.
