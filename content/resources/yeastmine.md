An integrated data warehouse of yeast genomic data. This data warehouse has been developed by the [Cherry group](http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/genetics/frdActionServlet?choiceId=facProfile&fid=4249) at the model organism database [Saccharomyces Genome Database](http://www.yeastgenome.org/), as part of the [InterMOD project](/funding/intermod), an initiative to set up interoperation between datasets from a number of major model organisms, including nematode worm, budding yeast, fruit fly, rat, mouse, zebrafish and human. YeastMine is also available as an iPhone app, [Yeast Genome](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/yeastgenome/id520868597?mt=8).
