A data warehouse of integrated fruit fly and other insect genetic, genomic and proteomic data, developed by the Micklem Lab using the InterMine data warehouse framework. It provides access to integrated data at a number of different levels, from simple browsing to construction of complex queries, which can be executed on either single items or lists. The datasets range from gene and protein annotations to pathways, homology, interactions, a range of ontologies, gene expression, regulation and diseases among others.
