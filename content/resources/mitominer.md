A data warehouse of mitochondrial proteomics data for a range of organisms, developed by [Alan Robinson's group](http://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/research/bioinformatics) at the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit based on the InterMine framework. The purpose of this data warehouse is to facilitate storage and analysis of mitochondrial proteomics data gathered from publications of mass spectrometry and green fluorescent protein tagging studies. In MitoMiner, these data are integrated with data from UniProt, Gene Ontology, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, HomoloGene, Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes and PubMed.
