Synthetic biology is an emerging field that seeks to apply engineering principles to the design of biological systems. This is a promising area of research, with the potential for both furthering our understanding of basic biology, and creating genetically engineered biological systems that have practical applications. This grant is aimed at doing a systematic analysis of bacterial genomes for useful genetic components, and creating a data warehouse resource containing this information, available for synthetic biology researchers. The role of the Micklem group within this collaboration is to analyse data from bacterial genomes, and set up SynBioMine - a data warehouse targeted specifically at the synthetic biology research community.
