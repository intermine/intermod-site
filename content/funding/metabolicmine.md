[metabolicMine](http://metabolicmine.org) is a data warehouse containing a selection of data from rat, mouse and human relevant to research into common metabolic diseases such as diabetes. The datasets include GWAS, information on disease phenotypes and associations across species, as well as standard genomic data such as gene functions and interactions. metabolicMine also includes all standard InterMine functionality, such as report pages, list analysis and flexible querying, with the added special feature of a regions search tool, The project was created with close input from research collaborators, and is hoped that the integrated data combined with the analysis tools will be of utility to the common metabolic research community.
