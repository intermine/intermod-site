The project site, and links to the respective InterMine databases, is available [here](http://www.crossmodel.org/).

InterMOD is an international consortium composed of the InterMine team and five model organism databases: budding yeast ([SGD](http://www.yeastgenome.org/)), nematode worm ([WormBase](http://www.wormbase.org/)), rat  ([RGD](http://rgd.mcw.edu/)), mouse ([MGI](http://www.informatics.jax.org/)) and zebrafish ([ZFIN](http://zfin.org/)). The aim of this project is to improve the infrastructure available for cross-species research, in order to facilitate analyses and make tools more widely accessible. It aims to do so by establishing a common framework for the different model organism databases based around the [InterMine system](/funding/intermine-and-humanmine), implementing shared standards, and enabling interoperation between the databases in order to reduce the time and effort required for performing cross-organism analysis.
