Infection by members of the parasitic protozoan phylum *Apicomplexa*, such as *Plasmodium* (malaria) and *Toxoplasma* are major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The problem is further compounded by the efficacy of drug treatment waning due to the  emergence of drug resistance in the parasites in questions.

The purpose of this grant is to enable the application of genomic and proteomic methods to further our understanding of host-parasite interactions during *Toxoplasma* infection. Specifically, we aim to study the manner in which the parasite controls gene expression for growth and development, and how the parasite disrupts host function through protein secretion. Insights into these mechanisms have the potential to be used for therapy development.
