[InterMine](http://www.intermine.org) is a data warehouse system developed by the Micklem group and already in use as a data warehouse framework by a number of model organism databases, including yeast ([SGD](http://www.yeastgenome.org/)), zebrafish ([ZFIN](http://zfin.org/)), fly and nematode worm (as part of the [modENCODE project](/funding/modencode)), mouse ([MGI](http://www.informatics.jax.org/)) and rat ([RGD](http://rgd.mcw.edu/)). As such, InterMine is a good system to use for developing cross-species inter- operability, and indeed this is the aim of the NIH-funded [InterMOD project](/funding/intermod).

This grant covers the continuing development of the InterMine framework, as well as the development of HumanMine - an extensive *Homo sapiens* genetics, genomics and proteomics resource built using the InterMine framework. The existence of HumanMine will both provide a new resource for human genetic research, and facilitate easier cross-organism research by creating improved links with model organism data.
